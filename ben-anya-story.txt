DW and KW decided to move away from Charlottesville forever. 
Many people had mixed feelings, but most were completely  distraught.
Ben, Anya, and Mallory, though, were secretly a little relieved.
Gradually, HackityC began to transform, and was inherently against
influencers. All HackyCInfluencerIncubator grads were forced to toss their 
technology into the #17 toilet and flush. Hard. The aspiring influncers were
livid. 

Ben, Mallory, Anya didn't care. Loss of influencer dues was insignifcant 
comapred to Impact's HUGE influx as a result of Ben's unrivaled charisma. 

DW was floored when his travels brought an unexpected engagement to his 
HC love, KW. 

The End!!
